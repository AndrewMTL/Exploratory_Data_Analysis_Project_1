# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project_1
Coursera: Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 1

This repository contains 4 R scripts and the 4 png files that they produce. They are for the week 1 course assignment. They build plots from the downloaded data exdata-data-household_power_consumption.zip from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Note: Please ensure that household_power_consumption.txt is in the working directory.

Each R script looks to see if the data has already been loaded and preprocessed. The full set of data is loaded as "consumption" and the subsetted data including only 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02 is named "consumption_subset". If you have a pre-existing variable named consumption or consumption_subset that is not produced by these scripts please remove them before running them or start a new R session.

The code that builds the plots is at the bottom of each script. The png files are 480 x 480 pixels.

plot1.R produces the first plot (plot1.png)
plot2.R produces the second plot (plot2.png)
plot3.R produces the third plot (plot3.png)
plot4.R produces the fourth plot (plot4.png)
